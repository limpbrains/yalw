Looks like my 8 hours are over, here is my summary

- I spent 1 hour staring the project, because I have nvm installed and latest RN started to show me an error
- Another 40 min I spent debugging lnd and macaroon error. I failed as a result there are only mock data in the app
- I wasn't familiar with new Redux Toolkit approach, maybe would be better to refactor Store to use it
- If I had a choice I would rather try something more modern lib for app state management. Like, Effector.

Things to improve:
- colors, font sizes, darkmode
- actually run lnd
- localization
- tests
- qrcode scanning and showing
- decoding and validating lightning invoices

Cheers
